# Economics Enforcement Engine

The economics model (roles, plans, funding sources, reservations, settlement — see
[economic-README.md](./economic-README.md)) is enforced for chat turns by the chat
entrypoint. The **enforcement engine** exposes that same model as a small, reusable
API so that any accountable flow — one that runs model calls on a user's behalf
without a chat turn — can verify feasibility, reserve funding, and settle actual
cost through the **same** role → plan → funding resolution, split, project→wallet
overflow split, and shortfall absorption.

Module:
- [enforcement.py](../../src/kdcube-ai-app/kdcube_ai_app/apps/chat/sdk/infra/economics/enforcement.py)

The engine reuses the owning entrypoint's runtime primitives (`cp_manager`, `rl`,
`budget_limiter`, `run_accounting`, `comm`, `logger`). It does not change how chat
turns are charged.

## When to use which entry point

The engine offers two entry points. Choose based on **who settles the cost**:

| Entry point | Verifies | Reserves | Settles | Use when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `EconomicsGuard` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | the accounted work runs *inside* the guard and you want it metered and charged |
| `economic_preflight` | ✅ | — | — | you only need a feasibility gate — the cost is metered elsewhere, or the caller degrades gracefully on denial |

Both verify the user's quota and funding **at the start** and raise
`EconomicsLimitException` when the flow is not feasible.

## Identity (who pays)

Every flow carries an `EconomicsSubject` — the resolved economics identity:

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.infra.economics.enforcement import EconomicsSubject

subject = EconomicsSubject(
    tenant="acme", project="main", user_id="u-123",
    roles=("kdcube:role:chat-user",),
    permissions=(),
    budget_bypass=False,       # explicit authority decision when applicable
    timezone="Europe/Kyiv",     # optional; anchors quota periods where configured
)
```

`EconomicsSubject` does not carry a `user_type` lane. Funding, subscription, and
plan access are resolved from economics state and explicit authority fields.

For linked/delegated identities the actor and the economics subject may be
different. A Telegram actor, delegated external client, or bundle-owned identity
should stay visible as the actor, while Connection Hub projects the economics
subject, roles, permissions, and explicit budget bypass from the carried
authority context.

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.infra.economics.enforcement import (
    economics_subject_from_authority_context,
)

subject = economics_subject_from_authority_context(
    tenant=tenant,
    project=project,
    identity_authority=bundle_call_context.get("identity_authority"),
    actor_user_id="telegram_434804821",
    fallback_user_id="telegram_434804821",
    timezone="Europe/Kyiv",
)
```

For **detached** flows (for example a job run later by a worker), persist the
`identity_authority` snapshot in the job envelope at enqueue time. The background
job processor restores it into `ExternalEventPayload.user.identity_authority` and
`bundle_call_context.identity_authority`. Privileged/admin bypass must come from
that authority projection; it must not be reconstructed from the dispatch queue.
Background queues may carry `queue_label`, but that label is not authority and
is not the economics subject.

## `EconomicsGuard` — verify, reserve, settle

An async context manager around a single accountable flow. On enter it resolves the
plan and funding, runs the rate-limit admit, reserves funding, and binds accounting
to the flow's `scope_id`. On exit it aggregates the flow's accounting events for that
`scope_id` and settles the actual cost across the funding sources (committing or
releasing the reservations).

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.infra.economics.enforcement import (
    EconomicsGuard, EconomicsEstimate, FlowPolicy,
)
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.infra.economics.policy import EconomicsLimitException

try:
    async with EconomicsGuard(
        entrypoint,                         # economics-enabled entrypoint
        subject=subject,
        scope_id="myflow_42",               # stable, unique accountable request id
        flow="my.flow",                     # label for logs/events
        estimate=EconomicsEstimate(reservation_usd=0.05),
        policy=FlowPolicy(enforce_concurrency=False, emit_user_events=False),
    ) as decision:
        result = await do_the_work()        # accounted model calls run here
except EconomicsLimitException as exc:
    # not feasible — nothing ran; inspect exc.code / exc.data
    ...
```

The `scope_id` is the flow's **accountable request id**: pick a stable, unique,
self-describing value (e.g. `<flow>_<entity_id>`). Reservations, ledger entries, and
spend are recorded under it and are traceable with
`GET /economics/request-lineage?request_id=<scope_id>`.

## `economic_preflight` — verify only

Use when you only need to gate the start of a flow and will degrade gracefully on
denial, or when the cost is metered by something else (for example a chat turn that
already settles, or a step whose cost you choose not to charge separately). It runs
the same admit + funding resolution but performs **no reservation and no
settlement**.

```python
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.infra.economics.enforcement import (
    economic_preflight, EconomicsEstimate, FlowPolicy,
)
from kdcube_ai_app.apps.chat.sdk.infra.economics.policy import EconomicsLimitException

try:
    decision = await economic_preflight(
        entrypoint, subject=subject,
        estimate=EconomicsEstimate(reservation_usd=0.01),
        flow="my.search",
        policy=FlowPolicy(enforce_concurrency=False, emit_user_events=False),
    )
except EconomicsLimitException:
    use_cheaper_path()    # e.g. skip the expensive model call, fall back
```

## Semantic Search Embeddings

Semantic search has two valid economics shapes:

| Search location | Guarding shape | Settlement owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Concrete service call inside a chat turn | active parent economics scope plus `EconomicsGuard` around the query embed | the guard performs verify-only admission and the parent chat turn settles the embedding event |
| Standalone UI/API search | `async with EconomicsGuard(...): await embed_texts(...)` | the guard reserves, binds accounting, and settles the embedding event when the block exits |

An active `EconomicsGuard` marks its own local settlement scope. The economics
chat runner marks the chat turn as the active parent scope while it executes the
bundle core. A nested search guard entered inside that scope degrades to
verify-only and leaves the tracked embedding event in the parent accounting
context. A search call outside an active parent scope creates and settles an
operation scope such as `memory_search_<id>` or `canvas_pins_search_<id>`.

The preferred component integration is a model-service facade:

- components receive one `model_service` dependency;
- `model_service.embed_texts([...])` embeds document/index material through the
  normal accounting-aware model service;
- `model_service.embed_search_query(query, flow=...)` wraps the actual query
  embedding in `EconomicsGuard`. The semantic-search facade returns `None` on
  economics denial so callers can degrade to lexical search; services without a
  fallback can let `EconomicsLimitException` interrupt the operation instead.

`make_semantic_search_guard(...)` remains as a legacy predicate for callers that
still have a guard hook. New searchable components should prefer the model-service
facade (`EconomicSearchModelService`, typically exposed by an entrypoint as
`search_model_service(flow=...)`).

The reservation amount for semantic query embeddings is computed from the requested
embedding provider/model in `price_table()` and the shared accounting token estimate:

```
reservation_usd = max(0.000001, estimated_tokens * embedding_tokens_1M / 1_000_000)
estimated_tokens = max(16, chars / 4) per embedded text
```

For `openai/text-embedding-3-small` at `$0.02 / 1M tokens`, short queries usually
hit the `$0.000001` floor. Larger batches scale with the same price-table rate.
Custom/self-hosted embedding backends emit embedding usage events too; they charge
non-zero dollars only when their provider/model is represented in the price table.

## Enforcement Traces

All `EconomicsGuard` and semantic-search facade paths emit centralized runtime
logs with the marker:

```text
[economics.enforcement]
```

The trace payload includes `flow`, `scope_id`, `subject_id`, tenant/project,
user id/type, and the stage-specific fields. Current stages:

| Stage | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `preflight_start` / `preflight_ok` | verify-only feasibility check |
| `plan_resolved` | resolved economics subject, plan, funding source, and reservation estimate |
| `admit` | quota admission evaluated and token reservation state known |
| `reserve_ok` | funding reservation created |
| `accounting_bound` | accounting context bound under the operation scope |
| `accounting_run_start` / `accounting_run_done` | usage collected for settlement |
| `settle_start` / `settle` | actual spend settled and remaining reservation released |
| `deny` | operation rejected by economics policy |
| `deny_cleanup` | reservations/locks are being released after a denial path |

Semantic-search economics denial logs a facade-level fallback line and returns
`None` to the caller, allowing lexical-only search when the component supports it.

## Contracts

### `EconomicsEstimate` — reservation size

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `reservation_usd` | primary lever: fixed USD estimate for the flow (most non-chat flows cost pennies) |
| `input_text` / `output_budget_tokens` | token-estimate path used when `reservation_usd` is not given |
| `min_tokens` | floor for the token-estimate path (default 500) |

### `FlowPolicy` — per-flow knobs

| Field | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enforce_concurrency` | `False` | take a concurrency slot (chat-only; background flows keep this off) |
| `reservation_ttl_sec` | `900` | reservation hold lifetime |
| `lock_ttl_sec` | `180` | admit lock lifetime |
| `emit_user_events` | `False` | emit `rate_limit.*` SSE events on denial (needs a `comm` channel); background flows log only |
| `enforce_quota_lock` | `False` | serialize the admit→reserve window per user with a distributed lock (reserving flows only; see *Quota lock* below) |
| `quota_lock_ttl_sec` | `60` | quota‑lock key lifetime (safety net if the holder dies) |
| `quota_lock_wait_sec` | `5.0` | how long to wait for the lock before denying as `quota_lock_timeout` |

### `EconomicsDecision` — outcome (returned by both APIs)

Carries the resolved funding path (`plan` / `bypass`), `plan_id`,
`funding_source` (`subscription` / `project` / `wallet` / `none`),
`funding_available_usd`, `est_turn_tokens`, `est_turn_usd`, `budget_bypass`,
`nested`, and `scope_id`. Useful for logging the decision and the applicable limits.

## Behavior notes

- **Denial.** When the flow is not feasible the API raises `EconomicsLimitException`
  before any work runs. `exc.code` is `rate_limited` (quota), `no_funding_source`
  (no eligible funding), or `quota_lock_timeout` (lock contended — see *Quota lock*);
  `exc.data` carries the snapshot. See
  [economics-events-README.md](./economics-events-README.md) for the event payloads
  emitted when `emit_user_events` is on.
- **Wallet overflow.** When the plan quota/funds are exhausted, the over‑quota remainder
  (`wallet_part = R − plan_part`) is drawn from the user's wallet within the **same**
  wallet‑aware admit — identical to chat `run()`, on every surface. The turn only denies
  when there is no wallet (or the wallet can't cover the remainder).
- **Settlement (guard only).** On exit, actual spend is settled with the same split as
  chat — plan quota + primary funds (subscription/project) first, the wallet for the
  over‑quota remainder, with the subscription budget's headroom and then the project
  budget absorbing any residual shortfall. A flow whose actual cost is zero releases its
  holds rather than charging. Subscriptions and wallets never go negative.
- **Quota lock.** With `enforce_quota_lock` on (and Redis available on the
  entrypoint), the admit→reserve planning window is serialized per user with a
  distributed lock, closing the read‑remaining‑quota → reserve race between concurrent
  requests of the same user. The lock is held only across planning and released before
  the work runs; if it cannot be acquired within `quota_lock_wait_sec` the flow is
  denied with `quota_lock_timeout`. It is skipped for `privileged`/`admin` (which
  bypass funding) and is only meaningful for reserving flows — `economic_preflight`
  takes no reservation and ignores it. Without Redis it degrades to no lock.
- **Nested safety.** If a guard is entered while an economics scope is already active
  on the same logical task, it automatically degrades to verify-only (the outer scope
  settles) so the same work is never charged twice.
- **Accounting binding.** The guard binds an accounting context keyed by `scope_id`
  so a detached/background flow's events are persisted and readable at settlement,
  even without a chat turn cache.
